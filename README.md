## what i am currently thinking about

- 🔲 cellular automata _(life finds a way)_

- 🤖 ai _(artistic intelligence?)_

## how to view

each experiment lives in its own folder with an html file that you can open directly in your browser. if there are any dependencies, they will be in the folder with the experiment.

using node:
```bash
npx serve  # → local: http://localhost:3000 | network: http://your-ip:3000
```

using python:
```bash
python -m http.server 8000  # classic approach (port 8000)
```
